# PolyLinkRPC
Flexible language agnostic and connection-based RPC implementation with bindings for different programming languages.

# Motivation
This is for fun and might or might not result in a working library. It is about getting familiar with GitHub and its workflows
as well as getting into C++ (the second time).
